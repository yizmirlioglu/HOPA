This folder includes Matlab/Octave scripts to generate consistent and inconsistent random benchmark problem instances for HOPA and OPRA used in the experiments. The names of the files are self-explanatory.

To create instances, specify parameters in the scripts (or use existing parameters) and run the respective script in Matlab or Octave. 


For example to create consistent benchmark instances for HOPA, run generate_hopa_consist.m
